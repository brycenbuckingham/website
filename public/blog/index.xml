      <description>Hey Y’all,
Thanks for tuning-in to another blog post! I just wanted to take some time to express my thoughts and interest in working with Python.
This semester (Fall 2019) is actually the first time that I’ve used or worked with Python. Previously, I’ve used RStudio and R to explore statistical relationships within data sets, but I’m now dipping my toes into something that’s new to me. So far, I’ve really fallen in love with Regular Expression Applications and analyzing DNA sequences with the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Walterman Algorithms.</description>
