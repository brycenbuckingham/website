Dear Readers/Viewers,

Welcome to my website! I'm so excited that you're here and reading this post. I will be using this website to document the happenings in my life, as well as the various projects I've worked on. At the moment, I'm just starting off with my coding career, so conent may be limited. But, before I discredit myself, let me tell you a little about who I am!

My name is Brycen Buckingham (although I go by Bucky) and I'm currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin. I was born in San Jose, California, but mainly grew up in a small town 30 miles to the south called Gilroy. You may have heard of it before, as it's dubbed "The Garlic Capital of the World." Yes, you read that right, our claim to fame is being one of the largest garlic producers in the nation. The accuracy of the title may be questionable, but we love our self-imposed accolade nonetheless.  

I attended a small elementary and middle school in the neighboring town of Morgan Hill, but I left "the farmland" to attend Saint Francis High School in Mountain View, California (for reference, Mountain View is roughly 40 miles north of Gilroy, and the halfway point between my home and San Francisco). I did a lot of commuting to say the least, but it's at Saint Francis HS where I began to discover my love for science. I had many amazing STEM teachers (shout out to Mr. O'Donnell, Mr. Ikezi, Mrs. Segal, and Mrs. Day) that left a large impact on my life and taught me how various aspects of science/math can be fun and intriguing. I graduated from Saint Francis HS in the spring of 2016 and moved to Austin, Texas later that fall to start my undergraduate degree in Biology at the University of Texas at Austin #hookem.

For my first two years as an undergrad, I was heavily focused on the premed route. I wanted to become an orthopedic surgeon and move back to the Bay Area to set up my own practice. But during my Junior year, I found Hospital Administration to be a more attractive career path for myself, so I slightly tweaked my degree option to include a business minor (still with the biology major). Currently, I'm studying for the GRE and applying to Master's programs across the nation for Hospital Administration, so here's to hoping that everything works out and that I'm able to attain my Master's Degree in the next four years!

Well, thank you for taking the time to read a little about myself. Please check out some of the projects I've worked on, and feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions!


Best,

Bucky


P.S. I am also a dog dad to a long-haired dachshund named Willie. Here are some photos for your enjoyment:
